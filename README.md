# Biosolutions

Sustainable solutions to address the effects of Climate Change on
induction of crop tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses.

## Goal
The identification of beneficial microbes from our "Biobank", which display plant-promoting properties
growth in at least one of the following conditions: extreme salinity, prolonged drought,
infection by a phytopathogen. 

## Experimental design
This project evaluates beneficial microbes that promote  
the growth of *Arabidopsis thaliana* under different  
environmental stress conditions. The workflow begins  
with culturing microbial strains to a standardized  
optical density (OD) and growing healthy *A. thaliana*  
seedlings. Plants are then inoculated with microbes  
and subjected to one of three conditions: drought  
stress, no stress (control), or salt stress. Following  
a growth period, various plant traits (e.g., biomass,  
leaf number, rosette diameter) are measured to assess  
microbial influence on plant performance.

Collected data is assembled and analyzed through two  
parallel paths: statistical analyses to identify  
significant effects (P < 0.05), and visualisation and  
curation for trait evaluation. Microbial treatments  
that result in statistically significant and  
biologically relevant trait improvements are classified  
as beneficial. This pipeline provides a structured and  
reproducible approach for screening plant growth-  
promoting microbes under stress conditions.

* The study of the compatibility of OEMs with the aforementioned properties, in order to create
synthetic microbial community with the combinatorial properties of its members.
* The control of the properties of the synthetic microbial community in bioassays on model plants.

## Genomics
Aims 

* The complete sequencing of the genome of the strains with the desired properties.
* Identify the genomic regions responsible for these properties.
