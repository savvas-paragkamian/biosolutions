# Biosolutions

Sustainable solutions to address the effects of Climate Change on
induction of crop tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses.

## Aims

* The identification of beneficial microbes from our "Biobank", which display plant-promoting properties
growth in at least one of the following conditions: extreme salinity, prolonged drought,
infection by a phytopathogen.
* The study of the compatibility of OEMs with the aforementioned properties, in order to create
synthetic microbial community with the combinatorial properties of its members.
* The control of the properties of the synthetic microbial community in bioassays on model plants.
* The complete sequencing of the genome of the strains with the desired properties.
* Identify the genomic regions responsible for these properties.
* The communication and dissemination of the results and conclusions of the project with the scientific community
community, wider society as well as with the private sector.

How many microbes in each condition? 

How many plants?
